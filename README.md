Serval Batman Inspector Library
==========================
This library is designed to make it easier for Serval related apps to find out about the underling B.A.T.M.A.N system without the need to call native code or deal with such things as Unix sockets.

The library is designed to be [referenced](http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/projects/projects-eclipse.html#ReferencingLibraryProject) by your own [Android Project](http://developer.android.com).

In the true spirit of the [Serval Project](http://www.servalproject.org) the development of this library is a collaborative effort.
