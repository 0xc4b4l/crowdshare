# After the first time, you should be able to build it from Eclipse
# (Why eclipse doesn't at least run the ndk-build to create the 
#  android/java conformant native binaries is a mystery to me).

# BUILDING ON WINDOWS REQUIRES THIS TO ALL HAPPEN FROM IN A CYGWIN
# SHELL, AND MAY STILL CAUSE PROBLEMS. WE RECOMMEND LINUX OR OSX
# AS THE BUILD ENVIRONMENT FOR SERVAL BATPHONE.
