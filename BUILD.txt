# To build Serval BatPhone the first time, run the following commands:
# (or just run ./BUILD.txt, since this file is a valid shell script).

ndk-build
git submodule init
git submodule update
cd jni/serval-dna
./nacl-jni-prep
cd ../..
ant debug

# After the first time, you should be able to build it from Eclipse
# (Why eclipse doesn't at least run the ndk-build to create the 
#  android/java conformant native binaries is a mystery to me).
#
# BUILDING ON WINDOWS REQUIRES THIS TO ALL HAPPEN FROM IN A CYGWIN
# SHELL, AND MAY STILL CAUSE PROBLEMS. WE RECOMMEND LINUX OR OSX
# AS THE BUILD ENVIRONMENT FOR SERVAL BATPHONE.
